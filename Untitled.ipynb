It requires a reservation and a separate ticket purchase. But for me, the real attraction is the dolphin training session it is truly special. The training session is free, and you have to try and catch the training at certain times. The staff will have a better idea of that when you arrive. It's not an actual show, it's just when the trainers come to the dolphin tank and practice with them. It is amazing what the dolphins are capable of and how much fun they have showing off for you. There is plenty of seating, so there is no need to stress about that. There are parking garages nearby for your visit and there is street parking but that can be harder to come by.

We ordered the small cold tower, the daily oysters, and a fillet mignon. The oysters were very fresh and tasted amazing. The cold tower had a variety of different seafood including crab, shrimp, and lobster tail which all were cooked wonderfully. The fillet mignon was delicious with the meat cooked perfectly. The view of the Inner Harbor from the restaurant is also very good, I would recommend coming here if you visit the area.',\n",

Ill start by saying that Patrick at the front desk is a freaking GEM. I NEED coffee in the morning and the line at Starbucks was nuts. He hears me tell my co-worker that we can’t wait in that line (we needed to get to the hospital) and instead of blatantly ignoring my cries for help, Patrick offers to get me a cup of coffee. I couldn’t be more appreciative of his attentiveness to such a small request. Take notes, Patrick has customer service down to a T!

I attended a family wedding where my uncle (with the same last name) had a separate reservation for the same time frame. They must have checked me in under his reservation (even when I provided my ID at checkout) and it caused the most insane headache for all of us. They arrived super late to check in and the front desk sent them up to my room at 2am - when their keys didn’t work, the hotel worker used the master key to open my door (while I was dead asleep) and THANKFULLY I latched the door so no one could get in. I did not hear a word of apology from the hotel for booking other people to my room and trying to enter my room while I was in it at 2am. That is completely unacceptable.\\n\\nThe next day, I get a call from the front desk asking me when I’m checking out. I proceed to tell them I am staying for two more nights. I am then called back again saying that my reservation was cancelled because I was marked as a no show, and my credit card statement currently shows almost $700 of charges on the day they claim I did not show up for my reservation, even though I paid for my stay in full when I checked in. Even after my uncle explained the situation when they checked in, the staff still had no idea what they were doing and were trying to tell me I never showed up for my reservation when they checked me in the day before.\\n\\nThe customer service at the front desk anytime I asked for help or had questions was really subpar. After the headache and violation of privacy they put me through, you’d think the staff would be super apologetic and working to make it right. I felt like anytime I went down to the front desk, I was inconveniencing them.\\n\\nThe bathroom had black mold in the corners of the room where steam collects. The carpet was definitely not vacuumed after the previous guest. I was worried to touch anything because I was concerned about the cleanliness of the rooms.\\n\\nI am not one to write bad reviews of places, but this was by far one of the worst experiences I’ve had in a hotel. I am usually a fan of Hilton, which makes this even more disappointing. I’d stay at the Marriott across the street if you get the chance.\\n\\nEDIT: The hotel figured out that the nearly $700 random charge on my card from them was the hotel charging my card for my uncle’s reservation, while also charging me for my reservation. They did not immediately refund me my charge. I asked my uncle and their card was indeed charged by the hotel… so the situation is nowhere near resolved. STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL!!!',\n",
